# AmachiromakerImgDownload
A python script that downloads the image files needed for Amachiromaker from charlie0129.
Surprisingly, Picrew have not removed the images from their CDN.
1. Run the script.
2. Paste the files into the described directory of Amachiromaker. Path to paste the files can be found in generateMakefile.js
3. Use the modified js here to replace the original one.
4. Run the docker build command.
You should find the program working perfectly.
