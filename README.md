# AmachiromakerImgDownload
A python script that downloads the image files needed for Amachiromaker from charlie0129.
Surprisingly, Picrew have not removed the images from their CDN.
1. Paste the list of images into the python file to start downloading. Can be found in Amachiromaker json files.
(two json files, around 1000 images)
2. Paste the files into the described directory of Amachiromaker.
3. Delete the parts of code that download the images from the Wayback Machine. Or just use the modified version here.
4. Run the docker build command.
You should find the program working perfectly.
