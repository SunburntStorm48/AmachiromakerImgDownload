# AmachiromakerImgDownload
A python script that downloads the image files needed for Amachiromaker from charlie0129.
Surprisingly, Picrew have not removed the images from their CDN.
1. Run the script.
2. Paste the files into the described directory of Amachiromaker. Path to paste the files can be found in generateMakefile.js
3. Delete the parts of code that download the images from the Wayback Machine. Or just use the modified version here.
4. Run the docker build command.
You should find the program working perfectly.
